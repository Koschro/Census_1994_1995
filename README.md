# Census_1994_1995

This project is based on the Census dataset 1994-1995 with demographic data about the American citizens for these year. From the description of the dataset we found that it contains almost 300,000 records with about 40 attributes. This dataset contains weighted demographic data from the census of America for the years 1994 and 1995, conducted by the country's Census Bureau.

Using this dataset we wanted to answer different interesting questions, such as what attributes lead to high income and what attributes to smaller income? In order to find the answer we implemented two classification technics, i.e. decision tree and Na√Øve Bayes, as well as association rules and logistic regression. Comparing the results from the 4 different approaches we will reach more solid conclusions about the factors that affect the income level.
